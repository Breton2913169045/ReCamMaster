## ðŸ“– Introduction

**TL;DR:** We propose ReCamMaster to re-capture in-the-wild videos with novel camera trajectories.  <br>

## ðŸš€ Try ReCamMaster with Your Own Videos

You can try out our ReCamMaster by uploading your own video to [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezOzGPbm8JMXQDq6EINiDf6iXn7rV4ozj6KcbQCSAzE8Vsnw/viewform?usp=dialog), which will generate a video with camera movements along a new trajectory. We will send the mp4 file generated by ReCamMaster to your inbox as soon as possible. For camera movement trajectories, we offer 10 basic camera trajectories as follows:

| Index       | Basic Trajectory                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | Pan Right                   |
| 2 | Pan Left                    |
| 3 | Tilt Up                     |
| 4 | Tilt Down                   |
| 5 | Zoom In                     |
| 6 | Zoom Out                    |
| 7 | Translate Up (with rotation)   |
| 8 | Translate Down (with rotation) |
| 9 | Arc Left (with rotation)    |
| 10 | Arc Right (with rotation)   |

If you would like to use ReCamMaster as a baseline and need qualitative or quantitative comparisons, please feel free to drop an email to [jianhongbai@zju.edu.cn](mailto:jianhongbai@zju.edu.cn). We can assist you with batch inference of our model.
